<h1>Speckle patterns</h1>
Speckle patterns are granular intensity patterns that result from the random interference of light. Such patterns appear whenever coherent light is randomised, for example when a laser beam reflects off a rough surface. 
<br> <br>
This is a quite universal phenomenon, although not easily observable under ordinary circumstances due to the lack of coherence of natural light. Since the invention of lasers, however, the production of speckle patterns has become extremely simple, and a whole field of optics has emerged around it, particularly in the domain of metrology. 
<br> <br>
That was the subject of my PhD, where I did a lot of interresting things, like measuring small displacements 10 times smaller than an atom, or measure variations in air density by 1 part in a billion! Find out more in my publications.

<p><h1>Arsenical books  </h1>
Recently I have been involved in a more applied and quite fun project: detecting Arsenic in old books. In the 1800s, bookbinders used a pigment, Emerald Green, for its deep vibrant green colour. However, Emerald Green contains Arsenic, which is highly toxic. It's not that they didn't know: they also used Emerald Green as an insecticide, at the same period! This pigment was also used in clothes and in wall paints. Lots of theater actors died from it, from which people inferred a curse. It might even be what killed Napoleon, who liked the colour so much that he painted parts of his house with it. 
<br> <br>
The presence of arsenic in book covers has been known for a long time, but only recently has it been recognised as a serious health and safety issue. Big national libraries in Germany and France have started to quanrantine thousands of potentially contaminated books, mainly based on visual identification and bibliographic data. However, there is currently no efficent way to instrumentally detect presence of arsenic. The exsisting techniques (X ray fluorescence or Raman spectroscopy) are slow, require expensive equipment, specialised personel, and data analysis. 
<br> <br>
My team and I have develloped an optical technique to solve these limitations. I also implemented this in a prototype that does the analysis automatically and gives a result in about 10 ms. This technique is less accurate than XRF and raman, but identifies toxic books with 100% true positive rate, 0% false negative, and 10% false positive, which is suitable for large scale testing in libraries. Publication in progress!

<p><h1>Quantum Quack </h1>
This is a personal project I have been working on with my friend <a href="https://github.com/rafkol98" target="_blank" style="color: yellow;">Rafael Kollyfas</a>. Quantum Quack is a quantum choice genetaor. It makes a random choice in a list of options you provide. The choice is made using quantum random numbers, rather than ordinary random numbers. 
<br><br> 
What's the point, you may ask? Quantum phenomena are qualitatively different from classical phenomena, in a way that differs depending on the interpretation of quantum mechanics you're partial of. In the most widely accepted one, the Copenhagen interpretation, quantum phenomena are fundamentally random. Indeed, you may choose your restaurant by throwing a dice, but this form of randomness is not fundamental: it follows the precise laws of mechanics, and could in principle be predicted in advance. The randomness of the output only emerges form the fact that it is highly sensitive to the initial conditions of the dice throw. On the other hand, in the Copenhagen interprettaion, quantum phenomena are fundamentally random, they are impossible to predict, even in principle.  
<br> <br> 
Quantum phenomena howerver never influence the course of things at human scale, because they are confined to the microscopic world. The course of our lifes are entirely determined by the initial conditions of the universe, just like the dice, even you reading this text right now.  
<br> <br> 
This is where Quantum Quack comes in. By making a random choice based on quantum random numbers, you escape determinism.
