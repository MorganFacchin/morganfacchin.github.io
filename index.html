                <p>Speckle patterns <br> <br> Speckle patterns are granular intensity patterns that result from the random interference of light. Such patterns appear whenever coherent light is randomised, for example, when a laser beam reflects off a rough surface, goes through a turbid medium, or is transmitted through an optical fiber. </p>

                <p>Arsenical books  <br> <br> More recently I have been involved in a more applied and quite fun project: detecting Arsenic in old books. The background is this: in the 1800s, bookbinders used a pigment, Emerald Green, for its deep vibrant green colour. However, Emerald Green contains Arsenic, which is highly toxic. It's not that they didn't know: they also used Emerald Green as an insecticide, at the same period! This pigment was also used in clothes and in wall paints. Lots of theater actors died from it, from which people inferred a curse. It might even be what killed Napoleon, who liked the colour so much that he painted his house with it. <br> <br>
The presence of arsenic in book covers has been known for a long time, but only recently has it been recognised as a serious health and safety issue. However, there is no simple way to determine the presence of arsenic.

                <p>Quantum Quack <br> <br> This is a personal project I have been working on with my friend <a href="https://github.com/rafkol98" target="_blank">Rafael Kollyfas</a>. Quantum Quack is a quantum choice genetaor. It makes a random choice in a list of options you provide. The choice is made using quantum random numbers, rather than ordinary random numbers. <br><br> What's the point, you may ask? Quantum phenomena are qualitatively different from classical phenomena, in a way that differs depending on the interpretation of quantum mechanics you're partial of. In the most widely accepted one, the Copenhagen interpretation, quantum phenomena are fundamentally random. Indeed, you may choose your restaurant by throwing a dice, but this form of randomness is not fundamental: it follows the precise laws of mechanics, and could in principle be predicted in advance. The randomness of the output only emerges form the fact that it is highly sensitive to the initial conditions of the dice throw. On the other hand, in the Copenhagen interprettaion, quantum phenomena are fundamentally random, they are impossible to predict, even in principle. These phenomena howerver never influence the course of things at human scale, because they are confined to the microscopic world. The course of our lifes are determined by the initial conditions of the universe, just like the dice, even you reading this text right now. <br> This is where Quantum Quack comes in. By making a random choice based on quantum random numbers, you escape determinism.  <br> <br> I host here the privacy policy of the app <a href="#privacy-policy" onclick="showTab('privacy-policy')">Privacy Policy</a>.
